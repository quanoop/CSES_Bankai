# CSES Problem Solutions (C++)

This repository contains solutions to various problems from the CSES Finnish Olympiad Computing Exhibition (https://cses.fi/problemset/). All solutions are written in C++ and include clear comments to explain the approach and logic.

**Getting Started**

There are no specific prerequisites to use this repository. However, a basic understanding of C++ programming is recommended.

**Problem Solutions**

The problem solutions are organized in folders based on the CSES problem categories. Each folder will contain a separate C++ file for each problem, named according to the CSES problem identifier (e.g., `task_1132.cpp`).

**Code Comments and Approach**

Each solution file includes comprehensive comments that explain the following:

* **Problem Statement:** A brief summary of the problem being solved.
* **Input Format:** Description of the expected input format.
* **Output Format:** Description of the expected output format.
* **Approach:** A detailed explanation of the algorithm or data structure used to solve the problem.
* **Time and Space Complexity:** Analysis of the time and space complexity of the solution.
